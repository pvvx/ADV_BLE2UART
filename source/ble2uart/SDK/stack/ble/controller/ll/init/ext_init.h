/**
 * @brief      This function is used to create an ACL connection to a connectable advertiser.
 *
 * @param[in]  filter_policy - used to determine whether the WhiteList is used. If the White List is not used, the Peer_Address_Type and the
							   Peer_Address parameters specify the address type and address of the advertising device to connect to.
 * @param[in]  ownAdr_type - indicates the type of address being used in the connection request packets.
 * @param[in]  peerAdrType - indicates the type of address used in the connectable advertisement sent by the peer.
 * @param[in]  *peerAddr - indicates the Peer's Public Device Address, Random (static) Device Address, Non-Resolvable Private Address, or
							Resolvable Private Address depending on the Peer_Address_Type parameter.
 * @param[in]  init_phys - indicates the PHY(s) on which the advertising packets should be received on the primary advertising physical channel and
							the PHYs for which connection parameters have been specified.
 *
 * 			   Attention:
 * 			   scanInter_0/scanWindow_0/conn_min_0/conn_max_0/timeout_0 are only for 	1M PHY.  If    1M PHY is not supported, these parameters are ignored.
 * 			   scanInter_1/scanWindow_1/conn_min_1/conn_max_1/timeout_1 are only for 	2M PHY.  If    2M PHY is not supported, these parameters are ignored.
 * 			   scanInter_2/scanWindow_2/conn_min_2/conn_max_2/timeout_2 are only for Coded PHY.  If Coded PHY is not supported, these parameters are ignored.
 *
 * @param[in]  scanInter_0 - for 1M PHY: recommendations from the Host on how frequently (LE_Scan_Interval) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  scanWindow_0 - for 1M PHY: recommendations from the Host on how long (LE_Scan_Window) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  conn_min_0 - for 1M PHY: the minimum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  conn_max_0 - for 1M PHY: the maximum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  timeout_0 - for 1M PHY: Supervision timeout for the LE Link.
 * @param[in]  scanInter_1 - for 2M PHY: recommendations from the Host on how frequently (LE_Scan_Interval) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  scanWindow_1 - for 2M PHY: recommendations from the Host on how long (LE_Scan_Window) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  conn_min_1 - for 2M PHY: the minimum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  conn_max_1 - for 2M PHY: the maximum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  timeout_1 - for 2M PHY: Supervision timeout for the LE Link.
 * @param[in]  scanInter_2 - for Coded PHY: recommendations from the Host on how frequently (LE_Scan_Interval) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  scanWindow_2 - for Coded PHY: recommendations from the Host on how long (LE_Scan_Window) the Controller should scan.
 * @param[in]  conn_min_2 - for Coded PHY: the minimum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  conn_max_2 - for Coded PHY: the maximum allowed connection interval.
 * @param[in]  timeout_2 - for Coded PHY: Supervision timeout for the LE Link.

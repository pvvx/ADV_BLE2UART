 *
 *             Attention:
 *             scanType_0/scanInter_0/scanWindow_0 are only for 1M    PHY.  If    1M PHY is not supported, these parameters are ignored.
 *             scanType_1/scanInter_1/scanWindow_1 are only for Coded PHY.  If Coded PHY is not supported, these parameters are ignored.
 *
 * @param[in]  scanType_0 - Scan_Type for 1M PHY, Passive Scanning or Active Scanning.
 * @param[in]  scanInter_0 - Scan_Interval for 1M PHY, Time interval from when the Controller started its last scan until it
                               begins the subsequent scan on the primary advertising physical channel.
 * @param[in]  scanWindow_0 - Duration of the scan on the primary advertising physical channel for 1M PHY
 *
 * @param[in]  scanType_1 - Scan_Type for Coded PHY, Passive Scanning or Active Scanning.
 * @param[in]  scanInter_1 - Scan_Interval for Coded PHY, Time interval from when the Controller started its last scan until it
                               begins the subsequent scan on the primary advertising physical channel.
 * @param[in]  scanWindow_1 - Duration of the scan on the primary advertising physical channel  for Coded PHY

 *              to prevent some unknown problems caused by a large frequency deviation of the RC clock.
 *            1. If the sleep function is not used and the accuracy of 24m rc is not high, then there is no need for regular calibration.
 *            2. If the sleep wake-up function is required, it is necessary to calibrate the 24m rc before the first sleep, otherwise it may cause the 
 *                  oscillator to fail to start after waking up.The recommended interval for regular calibration is 10 seconds. 
 *            3. If the 24m rc is more accurate, the oscillator will start up faster after waking up. If it is not accurate, the oscillator may not start
 *                  up after waking up.Therefore, regular calibration is needed to prevent the impact of temperature changes.

#include "flash_common.h"

/**
 *  If you add a new flash, you need to check the following location and add the corresponding flash model:
	#1 need to add flash_midxxx.c and flash_midxxx.h to the driver/flash directory, and introduce the header file flash_midxxx.h into flash_type.h.
	#2 need to add the corresponding mid to flash_mid_e in flash.h to check if Flash_CapacityDef contains the size of the added flash.
	#3 Check that flash_get_vendor() in flash.c and flash_vendor_e in flash.h already contain the added flash model.
	#4 need to add the corresponding mid in flash_support_mid[], and the Flash Type/uid CMD/MID/Company/Sector Erase Time(MAX) in the following table.
	#5 need to add a flash test area of corresponding size in Test_Demo/app_flash_test.c.
	#6 need to add the corresponding new flash to Flash_Deno/app.c in flash_lock()/flash_unlock(), as well as add the implementation of flash_midxxx_test()
	and add the case of flash_midxxx_test() in user_init().
	#7 If you add new flash (especially ZB), you need to confirm the new model, whether there is a problem that the lower the flash voltage, the longer the flash write time (BLE need to write 16bytes time is less than 200us),
	   if there is a problem, you need to modify the user_read_flash_value_calib function.(added by xiaobin.huang 20240802)
    #8 When adding new flash, you need to confirm the maximum operating current, not greater than 10mA. the larger the load on the LDO of the flash of the TC321X, the lower the VDD_F voltage will be,
       the present voltage settings are in accordance with the maximum operating current of the flash is evaluated at 10mA, if the maximum operating current is greater than 10mA, you need to re-assessment.(added by xiaobin.huang 20240802)

    If add flash type, need pay attention to the read uid command and the bit number of status register

/**
 * @brief		This function serves to read flash mid and uid,and check the correctness of mid and uid.
 * @param[out]	flash_mid	- Flash Manufacturer ID.
 * @param[out]	flash_uid	- Flash Unique ID.
 * @return		0: flash no uid or not a known flash model 	 1:the flash model is known and the uid is read.
 * @note        Attention: Before calling the FLASH function, please check the power supply voltage of the chip.
 *              Only if the detected voltage is greater than the safe voltage value, the FLASH function can be called.
 *              Taking into account the factors such as power supply fluctuations, the safe voltage value needs to be greater
 *              than the minimum chip operating voltage. For the specific value, please make a reasonable setting according
 *              to the specific application and hardware circuit.
 *
 *              Risk description: When the chip power supply voltage is relatively low, due to the unstable power supply,
 *              there may be a risk of error in the operation of the flash (especially for the write and erase operations.
 *              If an abnormality occurs, the firmware and user data may be rewritten, resulting in the final Product failure)

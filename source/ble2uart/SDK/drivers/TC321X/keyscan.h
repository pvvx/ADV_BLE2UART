/**	@page KEYSCAN
 *
 *	Introduction
 *	===============
 *	1. Keyscan can only save 9 keys at the same time in the same row, and can save 30 keys at the same time in different rows.
 *	2. In each debounce cycle, the hardware will finally store an end flag in the fifo.
 *	3. The duration of a single key must be more than 16ms.
 *
 *	API Reference
 *	===============
 *	Header File: keyscan.h

#include "flash_common.h"

/**
 * If you add a new flash, you need to check the following location and add the corresponding flash model:
	#1 need to add flash_midxxx.c and flash_midxxx.h to the driver/flash directory, and introduce the header file flash_midxxx.h into flash_type.h.
	#2 need to add the corresponding mid to flash_mid_e in flash.h to check if Flash_CapacityDef contains the size of the added flash.
	#3 Check that flash_get_vendor() in flash.c and flash_vendor_e in flash.h already contain the added flash model.
	#4 need to add the corresponding mid in flash_support_mid[], and the Flash Type/uid CMD/MID/Company/Sector Erase Time(MAX) in the following table.
	#5 need to add a flash test area of corresponding size in Test_Demo/app_flash_test.c.
	#6 need to add the corresponding new flash to Flash_Deno/app.c in flash_lock()/flash_unlock(), as well as add the implementation of flash_midxxx_test()
	and add the case of flash_midxxx_test() in user_init().

 	If add flash type, need pay attention to the read uid command and the bit number of status register.
	Flash Type			uid CMD			MID		Company		Sector Erase Time(MAX)

	ZB25WD80B			0x4b		0x14325E	ZB			500ms

	The uid of the early ZB25WD40B (mid is 0x13325E) is 8 bytes. If you read 16 bytes of uid,
	the next 8 bytes will be read as 0xff. Later, the uid of ZB25WD40B has been switched to 16 bytes.

/**
 * @brief		This function serves to read flash mid and uid,and check the correctness of mid and uid.
 * @param[out]	flash_mid	- Flash Manufacturer ID.
 * @param[out]	flash_uid	- Flash Unique ID.
 * @return		0: flash no uid or not a known flash model 	 1:the flash model is known and the uid is read.
 * @note        Attention: Before calling the FLASH function, please check the power supply voltage of the chip.
 *              Only if the detected voltage is greater than the safe voltage value, the FLASH function can be called.
 *              Taking into account the factors such as power supply fluctuations, the safe voltage value needs to be greater
 *              than the minimum chip operating voltage. For the specific value, please make a reasonable setting according
 *              to the specific application and hardware circuit.
 *
 *              Risk description: When the chip power supply voltage is relatively low, due to the unstable power supply,
 *              there may be a risk of error in the operation of the flash (especially for the write and erase operations.
 *              If an abnormality occurs, the firmware and user data may be rewritten, resulting in the final Product failure)
